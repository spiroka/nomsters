# Nomsters

This is my submission the for [Learn With Jason Web Dev Challenge hackathon](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/web-dev-challenge-s1e5-food-scene-hackathon). The prompt was to make something that gets people excited about their local food scene.

## The idea

Basically PokemonGO for restaurants. You find new reastaurants by collecting food monsters (nomsters) on the map. Each monster is some food you have to purchase.
You earn points by eating nomsters. You earn more points by eating a nomster that you have not eaten before.

## The tech

- Fastify + SQLite for the backend
- React for the frontend
- Clerk for authentication

## What got done

You can sign up using Clerk. Once signed in, you can start collecting nomsters. Eating a monster will earn you points.
